# Advent Of Code2023 - www.adventofcode.com

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023. Using Python again this year, but no longer with GitHub copilot. As usual, co-opeting with MgTheSilverSardine.

Using Python 3.11.4 .

## Interesting challenges:

- Challenge 7: a chance to use Quicksort. The poker challenge.
- Challenge 10 part 1: find the length of a path in a map. Djikstra not quite needed.
- Challenge 10 part 2: find the "area delimited by the path". Navigate along the edges keeping a direction + flood fill.
- Challenge 12: damaged springs -- a sort of string matching of different alternatives. Found a very fast solution, if not particularly smart, after a lot of silly coding to get there.
- Challenge 15: stupid challenge all about understanding the problem, not solving it. To throw off GPT-n?. Anyway, didn't like this one.
